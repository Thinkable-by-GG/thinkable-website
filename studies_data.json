      "summary": "This real-world data study examined whether brief, daily use of the GGSE (GG Self-esteem) mobile app was associated with improvements in self-esteem and mood ratings in a naturalistic setting. GGSE is a CBT-based app consisting of 46 levels (3 levels per belief) targeting maladaptive beliefs associated with low self-esteem such as self-criticism, negative thinking, perfectionism, self-efficacy, dealing with emotions, social fears, and abandonment fears. Users pull adaptive statements toward themselves and throw maladaptive statements away. The app includes tutorials, psychoeducational rationales, memory quizzes, and assessment levels. First 15 levels are free; additional levels require payment. Data from 5,320 users were retrospectively analyzed to assess dosage-response effects across three assessment points (Levels 1, 20, and 46). The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) was embedded as 'assessment-quiz' levels, and mood was assessed using a 5-point Visual Analogue Scale with face icons. This study tested whether findings from previous controlled trials would replicate in real-world conditions without research incentives or monitoring.",

The app consists of short training exercises (4 min/day for 14 days) intended to help women increase accessibility to functional self-statements that facilitate adaptive interpretations of thoughts, emotions, and events associated with body image. The intervention targeted maladaptive beliefs including over-importance of appearance, viewing body as aesthetic object, perfectionism, uncertainty about looks, and media literacy. Users learned to embrace (pull toward themselves) self-statements challenging maladaptive beliefs and promoting positive body image/body appreciation, while rejecting (throwing away) statements consistent with BID-related maladaptive beliefs. Participants completed an Instagram exposure resilience task at post-test and follow-up - browsing a pre-made Instagram account following attractive peers, celebrities, and 'thinspiration' accounts portraying thin-ideal body images for 10 minutes on iPad. To maximize compliance: 2 additional course credits for reaching level 54, lottery entry for two-person massage if no missed days, communications about progress on days 4 and 10.",

      "summary": "This crossover RCT evaluated the efficacy of GG OCD mobile app in reducing OCD symptoms and maladaptive cognitions during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Turkish subclinical sample. The app consists of 35 levels with 3 levels targeting each maladaptive belief (intolerance of uncertainty, fear of harm, 'not just right' feelings). Users complete short daily exercises (3 levels/day, ~4 min) learning to reject OCD-related statements by swiping them upward and embrace functional statements by pulling them downward. Each level includes several statements either consistent (dysfunctional) or inconsistent (adaptive) with maladaptive beliefs. Push notifications reminded daily use. Daily screenshots verified compliance. Study design: iApp group (n=25) started using GG OCD at baseline (T0) for 12 days (until T1), then follow-up at T2. dApp group (n=20) waited T0-T1, then used app T1-T2 (crossover). This was first study to assess GG OCD during pandemic and first to evaluate Turkish translation. Pilot study (n=20) validated translation before main trial. Multiple imputation with chained equations (MICE) used for missing data from dropouts. Supported by Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (Project 120K364). Context: pandemic exacerbated OCD symptoms, particularly contamination fears; government campaigns emphasized infection risk, hygiene, social distancing; traditional face-to-face therapy access severely limited by lockdowns.",

Intention-to-treat analysis with missing data imputed using Multivariate Imputation with Chained Equations (MICE). Series of 2×2 mixed ANOVAs with Time (T0, T1) as within-subject factor and Group (iApp, dApp) as between-subject factor. MANOVA for DASS-21 subscales to reduce Type I error. Bonferroni post-hoc corrections applied. Mauchly's Test of Sphericity conducted; Greenhouse-Geisser corrections used when sphericity violated (most measures). Significant Time × Group interactions found for OCI-R (F=11.37, p<.01, ηp²=.18), OBQ-44 (F=14.39, p<.001, ηp²=.21), IUS-12 (F=6.03, p<.05, ηp²=.10).

Groups equivalent at baseline on all measures except age (iApp older, t=1.50, p<.05). No differences in daily Instagram (t=0.53, p=.60) or Facebook use (t=0.15, p=.88). Excellent internal consistency: OCI-R (α=.89), OBQ-44 (α=.86), DASS-D (α=.89), DASS-A (α=.78), DASS-S (α=.82), IUS-12 (α=.89), CCS (α=.93).

Significant Time × Group interactions were found for all outcome measures including ROCD symptoms, obsessive beliefs (all 5 OBQ-46 subscales), self-esteem, and social anxiety. The iApp group showed significant improvements from T0 to T1 compared to dApp waitlist controls, and these improvements were maintained at T2 follow-up. The dApp group showed similar significant improvements after crossing over to use the app from T1 to T2. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large (Cohen's d = 0.61-0.96). Notably, reliable change was more common for primary ROCD outcomes (40-52%) compared to secondary outcomes like NJREs (10%). This pattern suggests the intervention specifically targets ROCD symptoms rather than producing non-specific effects. The study demonstrated that brief, daily cognitive training exercises can produce reliable, clinically significant change in subclinical ROCD symptoms, supporting early intervention and prevention approaches.",

Individual RCI calculated for each participant on all measures. Percentage achieving reliable change: ROCI (52% iApp, 48% dApp), PROCSI (44% iApp, 40% dApp), NJRE-Q-R (10% both groups). Internal consistency excellent: ROCI (α=.93), PROCSI (α=.91), OBQ-46 total (α=.95), RSES (α=.88), SIAS (α=.89), NJRE-Q-R (α=.94). Test-retest reliability established in pilot study (n=20, 2-week interval): ROCI (r=.89), PROCSI (r=.87). SCID-5-CV structured interviews conducted by two trained clinical psychologists (inter-rater reliability κ=.92). No adverse events reported. Compliance 100%: all participants completed all 45 levels.

Results showed that compared to the waitlist control group (dApp) at T1, the immediate intervention group (iApp) exhibited significantly lower misophonia symptoms on select measures (interaction effect sizes d=0.06-0.52) and reductions in anger ruminations and anger-related metacognitions (interaction effect sizes d=0.47). Within-group analyses demonstrated substantial reductions in misophonia symptoms from baseline to follow-up (iApp: d=0.62-1.51; dApp: d=0.89-1.75) with similar decreases in anger-related outcomes (iApp: d=0.89-0.92; dApp: d=0.85-0.90). Between-group analyses revealed significant Time × Group interaction for MISO-SCREE (p=0.019, d=0.52), marginal significance for AMISOS-R (p=0.073, d=0.40), and non-significant for A-MISO-S (d=0.06). Both anger measures (MAP-R and ARS) showed significant Time × Group interactions (both d=0.47, p<0.035). All improvements were maintained at 1-month follow-up. Mediation analyses did not support indirect effects through rumination or anger-related metacognitions, suggesting symptom reduction was driven by direct effects rather than through measured anger-related processes. The study demonstrated that brief, daily mHealth-based interventions can effectively reduce misophonia symptoms without requiring exposure to trigger sounds or face-to-face therapy, providing a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional CBT.",

Intention-to-treat approach with multiple imputation using multivariate imputation with chained equations (MICE) to replace missing values. Multiple imputation followed three steps: imputing over iterations, analyzing each completed dataset, pooling results. 2×2 (Group [iApp, dApp] × Time [T0, T1]) repeated measures MANOVA performed on six dependent variables. Type I error controlled using false discovery rate (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) correction (p<0.05). Adjusted criterion alpha=0.044 after 2 tests non-significant. Separate repeated-measures MANOVAs for each group to evaluate within-group effects across time points and at 30-day follow-up with Bonferroni corrections. Mauchly's test of sphericity indicated all measures met assumption of sphericity. SPSS PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2018) used for mediation testing with 5000-sample bootstrap procedure to estimate bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals. Mediation model controlled for baseline T0 levels of misophonia symptoms, anger ruminations, metacognitions, and demographic covariates (gender, age). Direct effect of condition on post-intervention misophonia: B=-0.1142, SE=0.0443, p=0.0118, 95% CI [-0.2024, -0.0260]. Total effect: B=-0.1159, SE=0.0429, p=0.0085, 95% CI [-0.2013, -0.0304]. Indirect effects through ruminations and metacognitions were not statistically significant: ruminations indirect effect=0.0079, 95% CI [-0.0177, 0.0327]; metacognitions indirect effect=-0.0096, 95% CI [-0.0402, 0.0113]; total indirect effect=-0.0017, 95% CI [-0.0348, 0.0249]. Internal consistency: MISO-SCREE (α=0.72-0.87), A-MISO-S (α=0.59-0.66), AMISOS-R (α=0.77-0.87), ARS (α=0.81-0.93), MAP-R (α=0.71-0.92), STAXI-T (α=0.78-0.85). Correlations at T0: Misophonia measures significantly correlated with anger measures (r=0.24-0.48, p<0.05). No baseline differences between groups on demographics or measures. No adverse events reported. Study approved by ethics committee."

      "summary": "This RCT evaluated the efficacy of a gamified mobile app (GG OCD perfectionism module from the GGtude platform) for treating perfectionism in college students. The app uses a unique pull/push interaction where users physically swipe adaptive cognitions downward (toward themselves) and reject maladaptive perfectionism beliefs by swiping upward (away from themselves). The app includes 9 thematic categories targeting core perfectionism beliefs including fear of mistakes, self-criticism, inflexibility, and failure intolerance. Each level includes psychoeducational rationales and brief cognitive training exercises (~1 minute per level). The study assessed primary outcome of concern over mistakes (FMPS-CM) and secondary outcomes including OCD symptoms, functional impairment across 14 life domains, emotional distress, and mood symptoms. Results demonstrated large between-group effect for primary outcome with maintained gains at 1-month follow-up, supporting efficacy of brief gamified intervention for subclinical perfectionism.",

      "summary": "This 6-month longitudinal RCT investigated whether combining mobile computerized CBT (GGSE module of GGtude platform) with post-training brain oscillatory modulation could enhance and prolong treatment effects for low self-esteem. The study tested the hypothesis that theta rhythm entrainment following daily CBT training would optimize memory consolidation and stabilize therapeutic gains. GGSE targets 11 maladaptive beliefs related to low self-esteem (e.g., perfectionism, self-criticism, social comparison tendencies) using brief gamified interactions with pull/push mechanics. The study included sophisticated neuromodulation using audio-visual entrainment (AVE) combined with cranial electro-stimulation (CES) at theta (5.5 Hz) or beta (15 Hz) frequencies. Contrary to the primary hypothesis, results showed no synergistic benefit of theta modulation - all three groups (theta, beta active control, and GGSE-only) demonstrated similar medium-to-large improvements in self-esteem that persisted for 6 months. This represents the longest follow-up assessment of GGtude platform efficacy to date and the first RCT comparing GGSE with active control groups, providing strong evidence for long-term maintenance of CBT-based self-esteem improvements via mobile apps.",

Unique pull/push gamified mechanics: upward swipe rejects ROCD thoughts, downward swipe embraces adaptive beliefs. Novel resilience task methodology: at T2 (post-intervention), participants exposed to bogus triggering article titled 'Not Getting Butterflies When You See Your Partner Is a Major Red Flag' to test resilience to stressful ROCD-related content. Assessments at T1 (baseline), T2 (Day 15, post-intervention + resilience task), T3 (Day 45, 1-month follow-up). Primary outcomes: Relationship-Centered (ROCI) and Partner-Focused (PROCSI) ROCD symptoms, resilience task ROCD symptoms. Secondary outcomes: Relationship Catastrophizing (ReCats), OCD beliefs (OBQ-20), adult attachment (ECR-S), relationship satisfaction (RAS), sexual satisfaction (CSFQ-14), general distress (DASS-21), social anxiety (SIAS).

      "summary": "This groundbreaking RCT is the first to examine concurrent mobile health app use by both romantic partners for relationship OCD symptoms. The study evaluated the GGRO app's ability to promote resilience to ROCD symptoms during stressful periods. A unique feature was the 'resilience task' - exposure to a bogus triggering article designed to elicit ROCD doubts, administered at post-intervention to test whether app training provided protection against symptom increases. The app uses gamified CBT mechanics where users physically reject ROCD-related doubts (upward swipe) and embrace adaptive relationship beliefs (downward swipe). Content spans 5 thematic categories addressing relationship doubts, trust issues, self-acceptance, relationship building, and attachment security. Results demonstrated that while both groups showed improvements on self-reported ROCD measures over time, the critical finding emerged in the resilience task: control group participants experienced significant increases in ROCD symptoms when exposed to triggering content, while experimental group participants who used the app showed resilience (no symptom increase). This suggests the app may provide protective effects during relationship stressors rather than simply reducing baseline symptoms.",

      "results": "Primary outcome analysis revealed the critical finding on the resilience task: after exposure to triggering content, control group participants showed elevated ROCD symptoms (M=4.23) while experimental group participants maintained lower ROCD symptoms (M=3.29), representing a large between-group difference (F(1,101)=14.89, p<.001, ηp²=0.13). This demonstrates that app use provided protection against symptom increases during relationship stress. For traditional pre-post measures, mixed MANOVAs showed significant Time main effects for both relationship-centered ROCD (ROCI: F(2,200)=3.86, p=.023, ηp²=0.04) and partner-focused ROCD (PROCSI: F(2,200)=4.39, p=.014, ηp²=0.04), with both groups showing symptom reduction from baseline to 1-month follow-up. However, Time × Group interactions were not significant for these primary measures, indicating comparable self-reported improvement between groups. Relationship Catastrophizing showed a trend toward Group × Time interaction (F(2,200)=2.89, p=.058, ηp²=0.03) favoring the experimental group. OCD beliefs (OBQ-20) decreased across time (F(2,200)=5.98, p=.003, ηp²=0.06) and relationship satisfaction increased (F(2,200)=4.12, p=.018, ηp²=0.04) for both groups. No significant effects emerged for attachment dimensions, sexual satisfaction, general distress, or social anxiety. Gender analyses revealed no significant differences, indicating both male and female partners benefited equally. Intention-to-treat analysis using MICE for missing data was confirmed by per-protocol sensitivity analyses. The pattern of results suggests the app's primary benefit may be building resilience to ROCD-triggering situations rather than simply reducing baseline symptoms.",
